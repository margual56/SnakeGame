# SnakeGame
The Snake game but with a torus-like space, meaning that exiting up makes you appear down and the other way around. The same with left and right.

## How to play?
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/margual56/SnakeGame/releases) and download the latest version! It is programmed in java, so it is cross-platform.<br/>
Currently, there's no way to adjust the size of the canvas or speed of the snake whithout modifying the code. 

## Modifying the code
Download processing from the [Processing webpage](https://processing.org/download/). You will need its `core.jar` library to edit, execute and export the project.

# Why processing?
The `core.jar` library is nothing but a wrapper for some of the nastiest java programming: Graphics. Technically, I could convert the whole progect to vanilla Java, but... why bother?<br/>
The executables in the [releases page](https://github.com/margual56/SnakeGame/releases) has the library packed into it, so there's no need to download Processing if you just want to play
